# Credential Revocation Registry

> In Progress

Storing Verifiable Credential on a distributed ledger could lead to privacy violation. However, we can store the status of a Verifiable Credential on-chain, with no private information attached to it. Issuers of a Verifiable Credential have the ability to revoke the credential and provide the reason behind it.

## Syntax of Verifiable Credential (VC) ID 

The syntax for Verifiable Credential ID is as follows:

```
vc:hid:<chain-namespace>:<method-specific-id>:<version-id>
```

- `sch:hid` - VC Method, where `vc` is the document identifier and `hid` is the method name
- `<chain-namespace>` - (Optional) Name of the blockchain where the VC status is registered. It is omitted for the document registered on mainnet chain
- `<method-specific-id>` - Multibase-encoded unique identifier of length 45

## Supported VC Statuses

Following are the VC statuses supported by `hid-node`:

- Live
- Suspended
- Revoked
- Expired

## Supported Hash Algorithm

We support the following hash algorithm for the attribute `credentialHash`:
- SHA-256

## Register VC Status

For instance, an issuer with id `did:hid:devnet:zEYJrMxWigf9boyeJMTRN4Ern8DJMoCXaLK77pzQmxVjf` has issue a VC, following which they want to register it's status.

CLI Signature is as follow:

```
Usage:
  hid-noded tx ssi register-credential-status [credential-status] [proof]
```

**credential-status Structure**

```json
{
    "claim": {
            "id": "vc:hid:devnet:z8BXg2zjwBRTrjPs7uCnkFBKrL9bPD14HxEJMENxm3CJ4",
            "currentStatus": "Live",
            "statusReason": "Credential Active"
        },
        "issuer": "did:hid:devnet:zEYJrMxWigf9boyeJMTRN4Ern8DJMoCXaLK77pzQmxVjf",
        "issuanceDate": "2022-04-10T04:07:12Z",
        "expirationDate": "2023-02-22T13:45:55Z",
        "credentialHash": "< -- Hash -->"
}
```

**proof Structure**

```json
{
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
    "created": "2022-04-10T04:07:12Z",
    "updated": "2022-04-10T04:07:12Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:hid:devnet:zEYJrMxWigf9boyeJMTRN4Ern8DJMoCXaLK77pzQmxVjf#key-1",
    "proofValue": "<-- Base64 encoded signature -->",
    "proofPurpose": "assertion"
}
```

The field `proofValue` holds the signature that was produced by signing the `credential-status` document. 

### Usage

The following command registers the status of a VC with id `vc_example1`:

```sh
hid-noded tx ssi register-credential-status '{"claim":{"id":"vc:hid:devnet:z8BXg2zjwBRTrjPs7uCnkFBKrL9bPD14HxEJMENxm3CJ4,"currentStatus":"Live","statusReason":"Credential Active"},"issuer":"did:hid:devnet:zEYJrMxWigf9boyeJMTRN4Ern8DJMoCXaLK77pzQmxVjf","issuanceDate":"2022-04-10T04:07:12Z","expirationDate":"2023-02-22T13:45:55Z","credentialHash":"< -- Hash -->"}' '{"type":"Ed25519VerificationKey2020","created":"2022-04-10T04:07:12Z","updated":"2022-04-10T04:07:12Z","verificationMethod":"did:hid:devnet:zEYJrMxWigf9boyeJMTRN4Ern8DJMoCXaLK77pzQmxVjf#key-1","proofValue":"<-- Base64 encoded signature -->","proofPurpose":"assertion"}' --from <hid-account>
```

### Querying Credential Status

1. Query credential status for given credential id:

```

2. Query list of registered credential statuses:

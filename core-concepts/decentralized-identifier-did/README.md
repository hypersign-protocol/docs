# Decentralized Identifier (DID)

## What is a DID?

As per [W3C DID v1.0 specification document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/):

> Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID.

In simple words, decentralised identifiers are cryptographically-verifiable identifiers which are stored on a decentralised ledger, which enables users to own and manage their digital identity.

The whole world is moving away from \*\*Web2.0 \*\*where:

* The internet is dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for personal data.
* The focus is on the company rather than on an individual.
* Data and control of that data is centralised and is been owned by the authorities
* Data silos exist.
* Business is given utmost importance.

to the **Web3.0** where:

* The focus is on an individual.
* Control and consent are being taken from the user.
* Data is decentralised and decentralised applications (dApps) take place of centralised web applications.
* User data privacy and security is given utmost importance.
* The concept of **open**, **trustless** and **permissionless** exist.

If you think from the context of Web3.0, you will realise FIDO has a \_\*\*trust problem \*\*\_and does NOT really fit for Web3.0 internet. Read the next section to know how?

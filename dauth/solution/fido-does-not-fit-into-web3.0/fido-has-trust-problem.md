# FIDO Has Trust Problem

So it all depends on how these public keys are stored and how it is being controlled. From the above figure, you can clearly see that the whole **trust relies on the FIDO server** (managed by IDP), which not only takes responsibility for **issuing the identity** (by storing public key at a centralised location) but also the responsibility of \*\*verifying the identity \*\*(which is soon going to be **scalability problem** - more on this in next section of the doc).

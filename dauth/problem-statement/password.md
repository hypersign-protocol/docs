# Passwords

Let us start with passwords:

1. They are the weakest form of authentication.
2. Remembering 50+ passwords is becoming a night mare for users.
3. Password reuse and sharing have become common practise by users.
4. People are barely updating their passwords becuase of fear of forgetting it.
5. Passwords are vulnerable to social engineering as well.

The list is long and the impact is high.

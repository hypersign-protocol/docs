## Voting

Voting is essential is deciding whether a blockchain proposal will be accepted or rejected. Only Validators and their delegators have the ability to vote on proposals. There are four types of vote:

- **Yes**
  - Agreement on the proposal
- **No**
  - Disagreement on the proposal
- **Abstain** 
  - Refrains from voting on the proposal
- **No With Vote** 
  - Strongly Disagrees on the proposal with intention of discarding the propsal
  - If 33.4% or more votes `No With Veto`, the proposal is discarded and the deposit is burned, unlike in above scenarios where the deposit is refunded to the proposer.

Proposals have the following types of statuses:

- **StatusDepositPeriod**
  - Time until necessary minimum deposit is made for a proposal
- **StatusVotingPeriod**
  - Time frame during which votes are accepted.
- **StatusPassed**
  - Proposal is passed and successfully executed
- **StatusRejected**
  - Proposal is Reject

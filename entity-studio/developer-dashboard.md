Upon successful registration, an API secret key will be generated for your app. You may use this API secret key to generate access token to access all SSI APIs. Read more about it in [authentication](api-doc/authentication.md) section.&#x20;

> [Make sure to copy and save API secret key securely. If lost, this key can not be recovered. However, you can regenerate a new one.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

Now that you have generated your API secret Key you can either go through our [API documentation](api-doc/) and start coding or jump into the [SSI API playground](api-playground.md) to play around with SSI APIs right before coding. Optionally, if you want  to get hands with concepts of the Self sovereign identiy (SSI), you can checkout [SSI playground](ssi-playground.md) for that.&#x20;

# DID

Please [generate access token](authentication.md) before proceeding.  Once you generated the `access_token`, you can pass this token as bearer authorization token in the header for all APIs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** Some of these APIs are on-chain APIs which means they need network fee to successfully execute, so make sure that your application wallet address has $hid tokens. Read [network fee](../developer-dashboard/network-fee.md) section for more details.
{% endhint %}

### Create a DID

Generates a new DID Document.&#x20;

There are 3 steps involved in DID creation:&#x20;

* Generate a DID Document : Generate the data structure of  the DID document.
* Sign a DID Document (optional) : Sign the DID Document using verification method.&#x20;
* Register a DID Document (optional) : Registers the signed DID Document on the blockchain network.&#x20;

You can use this API to do all three or choose to skip the optional ones via `options.register` property in request body by setting it `true` or `false`

* If passed `true` the DID document will be signed by new identity (publickey-privateKey pair) generated by the server and the will be registered in the [DID registry](../../concepts/decentralized-identifier-did/did-registry.md) and finally DIDDocument along with transaction hash and `registrationStatus` as `REGISTERED` will be return in the response.&#x20;
* If `false` the DID document will be returned in the response with `registrationStatus` as `UNREGISTERED`&#x20;

[api-json.json](../../.gitbook/assets/api-json.json)
{% endswagger %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**KeyTypes**: We support `Ed25519VerificationKey2020`, `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019` ,`EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020` verification method key types. Read the full [specification here](../../concepts/specifications/supported-signature-algorithms.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**PublicKey (Optional)**: Please pass the publickey only for `Ed25519VerificationKey2020 and EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019 keytypes` verification method key types. For `EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020, this property will be blank`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**WalletAddress (Optional):** Please pass walletAddress for keyType `EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020`
{% endhint %}

### Register a DID

Register a Signed DID Document in [DID registry](../../concepts/decentralized-identifier-did/did-registry.md). The Gas fee ([network fee](../developer-dashboard/network-fee.md)) for this DID regiration will be done by applications' walletAddress.&#x20;

> TODO: Add API Method here for /api/v1/did/**register**

### Resolve a DID

Given a DID Id (example: `did:hid:testnet:0x123123123123`) this API will resolve the corresponding DID Document from the [DID registry](../../concepts/decentralized-identifier-did/did-registry.md).&#x20;

### Fetch all DIDs for your apps

{% swagger src="../../.gitbook/assets/api-json.json" path="/api/v1/did" method="get" %}
[api-json.json](../../.gitbook/assets/api-json.json)
{% endswagger %}

### Update a DID

{% swagger src="../../.gitbook/assets/api-json.json" path="/api/v1/did" method="patch" %}
[api-json.json](../../.gitbook/assets/api-json.json)
{% endswagger %}

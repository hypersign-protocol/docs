# DID

Please [generate access token](authentication.md) before proceeding.  Once you generated the `access_token`, you can pass this token as bearer authorization token in the header for all APIs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** Some of these APIs are on-chain APIs which means they need network fee to successfully execute, so make sure that your application wallet address has $hid tokens. Read [network fee](../developer-dashboard/network-fee.md) section for more details.
{% endhint %}

### Create a DID

Generates a new DID Document.&#x20;

There are 3 steps involved in DID creation:&#x20;

* Generate a DID Document : Generate the data structure of  the DID document.
* Sign a DID Document (optional) : Sign the DID Document using verification method.&#x20;
* Register a DID Document (optional) : Registers the signed DID Document on the blockchain network.&#x20;

You can use this API to do all three or choose to skip the optional ones via `options.register` property in request body by setting it `true` or `false`

* If passed `true` the DID document will be signed by new identity (publickey-privateKey pair) generated by the server and the will be registered in the [DID registry](../../self-sovereign-identity-concepts/decentralized-identifier-did/did-registry.md) and finally DIDDocument along with transaction hash and `registrationStatus` as `REGISTERED` will be return in the response.&#x20;
* If `false` the DID document will be returned in the response with `registrationStatus` as `UNREGISTERED`&#x20;

### Register a DID

Register a Signed DID Document in [DID registry](../../self-sovereign-identity-concepts/decentralized-identifier-did/did-registry.md). The Gas fee ([network fee](../developer-dashboard/network-fee.md)) for this DID regiration will be done by applications' walletAddress.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Check "All' in all service for simplicity. But this will give "All" access of your dashboard to members including delete access.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Check out permission list to understand about these permissions:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../access-list.md" %}
[access-list.md](../access-list.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can see your role with name "**Admin**" is created with 3 permissions.&#x20;

Now is the time to assign this role to a member we previously invited in our account.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="assign-role-to-member.md" %}
[assign-role-to-member.md](assign-role-to-member.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

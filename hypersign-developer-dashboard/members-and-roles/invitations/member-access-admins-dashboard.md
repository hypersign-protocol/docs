# Member Access Admin's Dashboard

Once a [role is assigned](../roles-and-permissions/assign-role-to-member.md) to a member by the admin, a member can "**Switch**" to the admin's account right from their dashboard. Click on "**Switch Account**" on any admin you want to switch account to, present under **Invitation** page of **Members & Roles** tab in **Setting** page.

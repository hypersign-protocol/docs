# Actors Onboarding

First, all actors (Users, IDP and SP) need to be on-boarded on the Hypersign Identity Network. On-boarding is the process of registering public keys on the Hypersign network. Once an onboarding request is made, the blockchain stores their public key and issues them an identifier called, decentralised identifier aka DID. Moreover, one can also store information other than the public key which he might want to make public. For example, a bank can store the website url, address of the bank, IFSC code, etc. Take a look at the figure below.

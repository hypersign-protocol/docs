# Cost effective

Enterprises would like to run their own IDPs system and not trust any third party provider. This not only helps them to get control of their employee data, but also helps them to drastically reduce the overall cost of passwordless IAM solutions. In order to disrupt the Identity management industry, the main challenge is to provide “better security” at an “affordable cost” to an enterprise. Although this is fairly simple to achieve from a technology perspective, on the business side there are large corporations trying to consolidate control. For Example, major corporations (Cisco, Microsoft, Gemalto/Thales) charge customers an exorbitant fee for all these products and features. On the other hand, Facebook and Google who literally provide all the authentication and authorization services for free but at the cost of violating user data privacy, hence cannot be trusted by serious enterprises who are very much concerned about their employee data.

The current IAM solutions, like Okta, Keycloak, Auth0 etc., in the market can cost upwards of $30,000 annually, which may be very expensive for small and medium enterprises who want to have decently secure but cost effective IAM systems for their employees.

Moreover, converting username and password based legacy systems into passwordless solutions by adding a centralised 3rd party provider, like FIDO, OTP, etc. will not just further increase the overall cost of an already expensive solution but also increase the trust on these external entities. See the figure above.

Participating in the Hypersign network would not just give an enterprise an opportunity to earn rewards as validators, but also get access to applications and tools for managing the identity and access control of their employees at a minimal cost. This makes it not just secure but also trust less and a very scalable solution.

# More than passwordless

[A recent survey of U.S. companies](https://www.centrify.com/about-us/news/press-releases/2014/us-businesses-lose-more-than-200-000-annually-from-employees-struggling-with-passwords/) found that each employee costs an employer  average of $420 annually just grappling with passwords. With 37 percent of those surveyed, were resetting their passwords more than 50 times a year. The losses add up quickly, in productivity as well as  the cost of the support staff and the help desks. Lastly the  financial burdens are  even bigger.  As mentioned  earlier, passwords can be easily shared and therefore are the weakest link.

Hypersign goes one step further; not only does it eliminate the need for usernames and passwords in favor of cryptographic authentication, but it also adds the ability to exchange verifiable digital credentials for stronger, more flexible, and more resilient identity verification and access control.&#x20;

# Blockchain

The Hypersign Blockchain Network is the heart of the Hypersign identity ecosystem. The network is primarily used as a single source of truth of, public information such as public key, service endpoint and so on.

Although verifiable credentials are not stored on chain \[not even in the encrypted form], actors can connect to the network to verify other actors. The tamperproof nature of the network provides a guarantee about the public data it holds. Furthermore, the Hypersign Blockchain network is also used to incentivize actors, using its native coin - HID, who run and manage the network infrastructure.

> Hypersign is a hybrid blockchain network built based on the AeTernity Hyperchain protocol. The Hypersign identity network has the Proof Of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, but relies on Aeternityâ€™s Proof Of Work(PoW) main network for providing security, hence hybrid.
